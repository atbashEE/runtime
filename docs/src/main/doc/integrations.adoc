=== Java Flight Recorder

Atbash Runtime has support for the Java Flight recorder functionality.  When defining the option `--watcher JFR` or  `--watcher ALL` for the instance/domain, a JFR Recording is started automatically and written out when the JVM exits. Several messages are also created as JFR events and allow the analysis of the JVM behaviour.

The JFR file is created in the current directory.
