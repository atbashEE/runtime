= Runtime

A Jakarta EE 10 Core profile runtime.

== General

The product has several ways of operation

- standalone; Start up the runtime with one or more applications.
- domain; Start up the runtime and remotely administer the environment.
- clustered; Remote administration of several instances all running the same applications(s)
